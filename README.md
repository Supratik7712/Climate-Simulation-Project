🌍 Climate & Sustainability Simulation Platform

An interactive, web-based educational simulation that helps students understand climate change and sustainability through decision-based learning.

📌 Problem Statement

Climate change is often taught theoretically, making it difficult for students to understand the real-world impact of human decisions. There is a lack of simple, interactive tools that visually demonstrate how actions like energy usage, deforestation, and recycling affect the environment over time.

💡 Solution

This project provides an interactive climate simulation where users make sustainability decisions and instantly observe their impact on:

CO₂ emissions

Global temperature

Environmental health

The platform focuses on learning by experimentation rather than memorization.

✨ Key Features

🌱 Decision-Based Simulation – Users control renewable energy, tree plantation, and recycling levels

🏆 Badges & Scoring System – Sustainability score with achievement badges

📈 CO₂ Emissions Graph – Real-time visualization of emission trends

🎨 Clean & Intuitive UI – Optimized for quick understanding by judges

📚 Educational Focus – Designed for high school students

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling & responsive layout

JavaScript – Simulation logic & interactivity

Chart.js – Data visualization

⚙️ How It Works

User adjusts sustainability controls (energy, trees, recycling)

JavaScript simulation engine calculates environmental impact

CO₂ levels and temperature update dynamically

Scores and badges are awarded based on sustainable choices

Graphs visually display long-term effects
